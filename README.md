### Tokens
Please obtain Google API and Mapbox API keys and place them in their approperiate files `*-token.txt` within the `tokens` folder.
### Environment
Run the following code in terminal and use the `chicago` kernel to run the [`main.ipynb`](https://github.com/sadatian/cse6242-team175/blob/main/main.ipynb) notebook:
```
conda create -n chicago -c conda-forge python==3.8 -y;
conda activate chicago;
